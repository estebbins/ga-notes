## How To Ask For Help
<strong>Questions about a lesson</strong>:

- For general lesson questions and debugging post to the slack channel: `seir-66-ec-parking-lot`.
- For questions directed to the lecturer, or answers to questions posed by lecturer, please use the "raise hand" emoji in Slack.

<strong>Questions about code</strong>: please make a <em>descriptive</em> post about your issue in the debugging channel - include in it the relevant code snippet (use the Slack code snippet feature), some context around it, and the specific error you are receiving.

<strong>Requesting 1:1 instructor assistance</strong>: Instructors will be available for 1:1 time via Zoom, and will be happy to assist you. When you request instructor support, please be prepared to explain your thought process about the problem, and all of the steps that you took to try to solve it. Consider the following questions:

* What is your understanding of the error you're receiving? What clue does the error give you as to how to solve it?
* Did you look up the error in order to get a better understanding of what it means?
* What have you tried to do in order to remedy the problem?
* What lesson or outside sources have you referenced?

If you cannot answer these questions, the instructors may ask you to go find these answers before assisting you further.
